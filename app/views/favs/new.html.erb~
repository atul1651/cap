                                    <p class="text-muted">Humble Beginnings was an American pop punk band from New Jersey. While never gaining large-scale success, many of the band's members went on to mainstream success with other outfits.

Formed in 1996, Humble Beginnings originally consisted of Chris Delvecchio, Joshua Scott-Dicker, and Gabe Saporta. Their first release was a five-song demo cassette tape. At one point Eben D'Amico, former long-time bassist of Saves the Day, served as the band's bassist.

On September 29, 2010 it was announced that Humble Beginnings would perform two reunion shows in NJ. One at Maxwell's and one at The Court Tavern on November 19 and 20.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">An economic expansion is an increase in the level of economic activity, and of the goods and services available. It is a period of economic growth as measured by a rise in real GDP.[1] The explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity between economic expansions and contractions is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics.

Typically an economic expansion is marked by an upturn in production and utilization of resources. Economic recovery and prosperity are two successive phases of expansion. Expansion may be caused by factors external to the economy, such as weather conditions or technical change, or by factors internal to the economy, such as fiscal policies, monetary policies, the availability of credit, interest rates, regulatory policies or other impacts on producer incentives. Global conditions may influence the levels of economic activity in various countries.</p>
